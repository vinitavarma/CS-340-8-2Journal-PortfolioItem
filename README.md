1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the 
dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? I write programs 
that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable through the use of collaboration and long-term development. Based on my experience with the CRUD module, I've used modular code design, 
error handling, testing/validation, code documentation, adaptability/flexibility, comments/documentation, and some variables names that are clear to describe while connecting the 
dashboard widgets to a database in Project Two. The advantages of working in this way are reusability, readability, maintainability, and adaptability.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to 
this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? I approach 
one problem as a computer scientist by including approaches that structured and analytical to solving other problems. I also approached the database and dashboard requirements given by 
Grazioso Salvare. It made by understand the problem along with their specific needs for databases/dashboards, data storage, retrieval, and visualization requirements. According to 
the situation, there was requirement analysis, researcher/planning, design/architecture, implementation, documentation, feedback along with continuous improvement, and interactive 
clients. The techniques or strategies I would use in the future for creating databases exceeding other requests from clients are selecting the right DBMS, conducting through client 
interviews/requirements gathering to understand their needs and goals deeply, increasing data growth/scalability, and keeping in touch with emerging technologies in database management 
systems along with data visualization for providing some innovative solutions.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? Computer scientists 
play a major role in solving complex problems, advancing technology, and developing various aspects of modern society. My work on this kind of project help a company such as Grazioso 
Salvare do better work by analyzing data. Other things that they do is work on algorithm design, software development, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence/machine learning, database
management, and computer systems/network. It matters because computer scientists have productivity/efficiency, innovation, security, access to information, improved user experience, and
decisions that are driven through data. According to the situation, their work aids other organizations to operate more efficiently, create data-driven decisions, and provide some better
services to their customers, especially with contribution to the growth and competitiveness of the company recently.
